## Selector Tips

| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| ID | `#submit-button` | Unique elements |
| Class | `.btn-primary` | Styled elements |
| Attribute | `[data-testid="login"]` | **Recommended** - Stable |
| CSS | `nav > ul > li:first-child` | Complex queries |
| XPath | (use sparingly) | Complex DOM |

```bash
mcporter call playwright-mcp.browser_wait_for_selector selector=".slow" timeout=60000
```
