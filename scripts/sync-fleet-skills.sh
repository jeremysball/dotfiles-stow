#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sync-fleet-skills.sh: keep the fleet (opencode + kilo) pointed at the same
# skill registry Claude Code uses, and stop the plugin-skill symlinks from
# rotting on every plugin update.
#
# The problem this exists for:
#   Plugin skills do not live at a fixed path. They live behind a version:
#     ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/superpowers/6.3.0/skills/
#                                                                ^^^^^
#   When a plugin updates, Claude Code writes a NEW version directory and the
#   old one goes away. Anything that named the old path (a symlink, a config
#   key) silently dangles. That is exactly how ~/.config/opencode/skills/ ended
#   up with 25 dead links: 16 pinned to superpowers 6.1.1 (installed: 6.3.0)
#   and 9 pointing at /home/node/..., a container path from a machine that no
#   longer exists. opencode was loading 1 of 14 superpowers skills and 0 of the
#   115 personal ones.
#
# The fix, in two halves:
#   1. A stable directory, ~/.claude/fleet-skills/, holding one symlink per
#      plugin skill. The path has no version in it, so config files can name
#      it once and never change. This script rewrites the links inside it.
#   2. Both tools declare the registry in config via their native `skills.paths`
#      key (opencode and kilo share the same schema; kilo is an opencode fork):
#          "skills": { "paths": ["~/.claude/skills", "~/.claude/fleet-skills"] }
#      Personal skills need no symlinks at all, since ~/.claude/skills is
#      already a stable path.
#
# Why the links are RELATIVE and tracked:
#   ~/.claude is its own repo (jeremysball/dotclaude) and fleet-skills/ is
#   tracked in it. Git stores a symlink as its literal target string, so an
#   absolute target would commit "/home/jeremy/..." plus a pinned version into
#   a repo that clones onto other machines. Relative targets drop the username.
#   The version stays on purpose: the tracked links act as a lockfile, so a
#   plugin update shows up as a reviewable git diff in dotclaude and --check
#   reports the lockfile as stale.
#
# Source of truth for "which version is current" is the manifest Claude Code
# already maintains, ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json, never a glob of
# the cache directory (which keeps stale version directories around).
#
# Modes:
#   (no args)        Repair. Rewrite ~/.claude/fleet-skills/ to match the
#                    manifest, pruning links for skills that no longer exist.
#   --check          Alert only. Report every drift with its path, exit 1.
#                    Never writes. This is `mise run check-fleet-skills`.
#   --tracked-only   Alert only, for the global pre-commit hook and CI.
#                    Validates the two things a commit can break without any
#                    runtime state: the tracked kilo/opencode configs still
#                    declare both skill paths, and every committed fleet-skills
#                    link is relative and resolves.
#   --verbose / -v   Print each link as it is checked or written.
#
# Exit 0 = everything holds. Exit 1 = drift found (each one printed with its
# path and reason). Exit 2 = bad usage.
#
# Note on taskferry: ~/.claude is on taskferry's sandbox deny-list
# (src/sandbox.js defaultDenyList), masked with a tmpfs. A ferried worker
# therefore sees none of this, symlink or not, because a symlink resolves
# against the sandbox namespace. That is deliberate and unchanged by this
# script; binding it back is a per-dispatch --ro-bind decision, not a default.
