#
# Wires a repo's .githooks/ so the global gates in ~/.config/git/hooks run
# even though the repo sets its own core.hooksPath.
#
# The problem this fixes: core.hooksPath is single-valued and repo-local
# config beats global config, with no merging. A repo that sets
# `core.hooksPath = .githooks` for portability (so a contributor's bare
# clone still gets hooks) silently disables every global hook on this
# machine. Measured 2026-09-01: sixteen repos set the local override and
# not one of them carried the global em-dash gate, so that gate had never
# fired on a commit in any of them.
#
# The fix is a shim. .githooks/<hook> becomes a two-step dispatcher:
#   1. run the global hook of the same name, if this machine has one
#   2. run the repo's own hook, moved aside to .githooks/<hook>.local
# A contributor without dotfiles skips step 1 and still gets step 2.
#
# GIT_HOOKS_CHAINED guards against a loop: the global pre-commit chains
# down to .githooks/<hook> itself, and would otherwise re-enter the shim.
#
# Idempotent. Re-running on an already-shimmed repo replaces the shim and
# leaves .local alone.

  # Always relative, even where the repo previously recorded an absolute

  # runs its own .githooks; an absolute one pins every worktree to the
  # primary checkout's files. That difference is not cosmetic here. All work
  # in this setup happens in linked worktrees, so under an absolute path a
  # worktree that has the shim still commits through the primary checkout's
  # unshimmed hook, and the global gates never fire where the commits are
  # actually made. Verified 2026-09-03 on a scratch repo: identical shims,
  # em dash blocked under `.githooks`, committed clean under the absolute
  # form.

  # $root, not the primary checkout. core.hooksPath is repo-wide config, and

  # file every worktree reads (verified: the write from a worktree lands in
  # <primary>/.git/config). Since the value is now the constant .githooks
  # rather than a path, there is no worktree path left to record wrongly.
  # Resolving the primary checkout as dirname(--git-common-dir) instead was
  # actively wrong: for a submodule it yields <super>/.git/modules, so the
  # write lands in the superproject's config and the submodule never gets
  # one; for --separate-git-dir and bare-repo worktrees it yields a
  # non-repository and the script dies under set -e after the shims are
  # already written. All three reproduced on scratch repos 2026-09-03.
